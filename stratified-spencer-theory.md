# Stratified Spencer Cohomology: The Mathematics of Physical Hierarchy

Understanding how geometric stratification creates hierarchical structures in physical conservation laws.

## The Stratification Principle

Physical systems naturally organize themselves into regions with different constraint structures. In fluid dynamics, high-vorticity regions behave differently from low-vorticity regions. In gauge theories, different topological sectors have distinct properties. In condensed matter, bulk and boundary regions support different excitations.

Stratified Spencer cohomology formalizes this observation: the Spencer complex adapts to local geometric structure, revealing how conservation laws emerge, merge, or disappear as one moves between different regions of the system.

## Mathematical Structure

The stratification arises from the varying dimension of stabilizer groups across the system. Where the stabilizer group is large, the system has more local symmetry and supports more conservation laws. Where the stabilizer group is small, the system is more constrained and has fewer invariants.

This creates a hierarchical structure:
- Global strata: conservation laws that hold throughout the system
- Intermediate strata: conservation laws that hold in extended regions
- Local strata: conservation laws that exist only in specific locations

## Physical Consequences

**Emergence**: Complex global behavior emerges from the interaction between different strata, each with its own conservation laws.

**Stability**: Transitions between strata explain why certain configurations are stable (they minimize the number of strata boundaries) while others are unstable.

**Critical Phenomena**: Phase transitions occur when the stratification structure changes, creating or destroying strata and their associated conservation laws.

**Topological Protection**: Some conservation laws are topologically protected - they cannot be destroyed without changing the global stratification structure.
